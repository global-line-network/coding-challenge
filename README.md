Thanks for taking the time to do our front-end / full-stack practical coding challenge.

The objective of this challenge is to evaluate your domain knowledge in front-end / full-stack development: code organization, style and best practices.

# Overview:
The main challenge will be to build a simple user management tool that will perform basic CRUD operations on a user. Please use mockups as a reference 
about look of the application. There are no business rules & guidelines other than to show us what youâ€™re truly made of. It can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be.

### Prerequisites
There are none :) Our main solutions stack include but not limited to Kotlin, Java, AngularJS, Flutter, Spring...
Feel free to use any languages and technologies you are comfortable with.

## Mockups

### Front-end:
- For API please use https://reqres.in/.

### Back-end:
- The API should be similar to https://reqres.in/, performing basic operations for user.

_We'll be happy if you cover application with tests._

### Submission Guidelines
- Please fork the repo and then submit a Pull Request when you are done.
- Instructions must be provided to run the application, install any dependencies, and any other information needed.
- Please use version control and make sure we can see the history of how you went about it, rather than just uploading the complete project to GitHub.

## Questions? ###
Please feel free to reach out and ask any questions while you are working on a solution.  
Send your questions to [tech@chimaera.my](mailto:tech@chimaera.my).  
  
  
Good luck!

### Running project
To run this project we have to setup our development environment.  
  
- Install Java JDK 8, you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)  
- Instruction on JDK 8 installation setup: [setup JDK 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html)  
- Install Maven 3.6.3, you can download it from [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)  
- Intruction on Maven setup: [setup Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)  
- After maven has already installed, go to terminal and go to this root project folder  
- And then from inside of this root project run this command: `mvn springboot:run`
- After this project started, then you can check it using this URL from your browser http://localhost:8080/api/user
