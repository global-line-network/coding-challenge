### Front-end:

### Back-end:

- The API should be similar to https://reqres.in/, performing basic operations for user.

_We'll be happy if you cover application with tests._

### Submission Guidelines

- Please fork the repo and then submit a Pull Request when you are done.
- Instructions must be provided to run the application, install any dependencies, and any other information needed.
- Please use version control and make sure we can see the history of how you went about it, rather than just uploading the complete project to GitHub.
